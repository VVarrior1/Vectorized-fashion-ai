# AI Product Recommendation System: Approach, Challenges, and Learnings

## Approach

This project implements a multimodal AI product recommendation system that combines text and image embeddings for fashion product recommendations. The approach consisted of several key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:

   - Created a small curated dataset of fashion products with titles, descriptions, and images
   - Used Unsplash images for product visuals and crafted detailed product descriptions
   - Structured the data to support both text and image-based recommendations

2. **Embedding Generation**:

   - Used SentenceTransformers for text embeddings (with OpenAI as an option)
   - Implemented CLIP for image embeddings to capture visual features
   - Created a combined embedding approach by concatenating normalized text and image embeddings

3. **Vector Database Implementation**:

   - Used FAISS for efficient similarity search
   - Created separate indices for text, image, and combined embeddings
   - Implemented metadata storage alongside embeddings for rich result retrieval

4. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**:

   - Utilized OpenAI's API to generate enhanced product descriptions
   - Implemented product comparisons using similar items as context
   - Created styling suggestions based on retrieved similar products

5. **Mobile App UI**:
   - Built a Streamlit interface for an intuitive, responsive mobile experience
   - Implemented multiple search modalities (text, image, browsing)
   - Designed a product detail view with recommendation panels

## Challenges

Several challenges were encountered during development:

1. **Multimodal Embedding Fusion**:

   - Finding the optimal way to combine text and image embeddings was non-trivial
   - Different embedding spaces had different dimensionalities and distributions
   - Solution: Used normalization and concatenation with proper weighting

2. **Cold Start Problem**:

   - Without user history, initial recommendations lack personalization
   - Solution: Focused on content-based recommendations using product features

3. **Computational Efficiency**:

   - CLIP model can be resource-intensive for image embedding generation
   - Solution: Implemented caching of embeddings and pre-computed vector databases

4. **Effective RAG Implementation**:

   - Crafting prompts that produce useful, context-aware content
   - Solution: Structured prompts with clear roles and detailed product context

5. **Cross-Modal Search Quality**:
   - Ensuring that searches work well across both text and image modalities
   - Solution: Created separate indices for different modalities with appropriate similarity metrics

## Learnings

The project provided several valuable insights:

1. **Vector Databases are Powerful**:

   - FAISS provides extremely fast similarity search even with large embedding sets
   - Proper indexing structure selection (flat vs. hierarchical) is critical for balancing speed and accuracy

2. **Multimodal AI Benefits**:

   - Combining text and image modalities creates more robust recommendations
   - Different modalities can complement each other's weaknesses

3. **RAG Effectiveness**:

   - RAG significantly enhances the quality of product descriptions and comparisons
   - Context from similar products improves the relevance of generated content

4. **Embedding Quality Matters**:

   - The choice of embedding model significantly impacts recommendation quality
   - Domain-specific fine-tuning could further improve results

5. **UI Considerations for AI Products**:
   - Clear explanation of AI capabilities helps set user expectations
   - Providing multiple search modalities accommodates different user preferences
   - Progressive disclosure of advanced features prevents overwhelming users

## Future Directions

Based on the learnings from this project, several promising directions for future work include:

1. Training domain-specific embedding models for fashion items
2. Implementing hybrid recommendation approaches that combine content-based and collaborative filtering
3. Adding personalization based on user interactions and preferences
4. Expanding to video-based product demonstrations with appropriate embeddings
5. Implementing more sophisticated multimodal fusion techniques

The combination of vector search and RAG demonstrates significant potential for enhancing e-commerce experiences, making product discovery more intuitive and informative for users.
